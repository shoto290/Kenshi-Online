# Kenshi-Online (Fork)

**16-player co-op multiplayer mod for Kenshi**

Forked from [The404Studios/Kenshi-Online](https://github.com/The404Studios/Kenshi-Online) (v1.0.2).

This fork replaces the UDP-based master server with our HTTP REST API for server discovery, registration, and heartbeat. The ENet game networking remains unchanged.

## Features

- **Up to 16 players** on a single server
- **Dedicated server** with persistence and console commands
- **REST API master server** for server browser and discovery
- **Full network replication** — characters, NPCs, combat, buildings, items
- **Zone-based sync** — efficient bandwidth usage with interest management
- **Server-authoritative** combat and world state
- **Native MyGUI HUD** — status bar, chat with timestamps, player list, debug log
- **Client commands** — `/tp`, `/time`, `/kick`, `/announce`, `/connect`, `/disconnect`, `/pos`, `/players`, `/status`, `/entities`, `/ping`, `/debug`, `/help`
- **Just launch and play** — Ogre plugin injection, no manual setup

## Architecture

```
KenshiMP.Injector.exe    -> Modifies Plugins_x64.cfg, launches Kenshi
KenshiMP.Core.dll        -> Loaded by Ogre as a plugin, hooks game functions
KenshiMP.Server.exe      -> Dedicated server (host on VPS or locally)
KenshiMP.Common.lib      -> Shared types, protocol, serialization
KenshiMP.Scanner.lib     -> Pattern scanning, MinHook wrapper
```

> The original `KenshiMP.MasterServer` has been removed. Server discovery uses our HTTP REST API.

## What to Expect In-Game

After connecting, your character syncs to the server. Other players' characters will appear when you **walk near a town or NPC group** — this is by design. The mod uses Kenshi's own NPC creation events to safely spawn remote characters with valid game state.

You will see HUD messages guiding you:
- **"Connected to server"** — you're online
- **"Walk near NPCs to trigger character spawns"** — move toward a town to see other players
- **"[PlayerName] joined"** — another player connected

### Known Behavior
- Remote characters appear after you walk near NPCs (towns, patrols, caravans)
- First spawn may take 10-30 seconds while the game loads nearby NPC zones
- If a player disconnects, their character is cleaned up automatically
- The host's game speed controls time for all players

## Quick Start

### Player (Pre-built Release)
1. Download `KenshiMP-Install.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/The404Studios/Kenshi-Online/releases/latest)
2. Extract to your Kenshi folder
3. Run `KenshiMP.Injector.exe`
4. Set your player name and server address
5. Click **PLAY** — Kenshi launches with multiplayer enabled

### Server (Local or VPS)
1. Copy `KenshiMP.Server.exe` to your VPS
2. Create `server.json` (or let it generate defaults):
```json
{
  "serverName": "My Kenshi Server",
  "port": 27800,
  "maxPlayers": 16,
  "pvpEnabled": true,
  "gameSpeed": 1.0,
  "masterServerUrl": "https://your-master-server.example.com",
  "masterServerApiKey": "your-api-key"
}
```
3. Run: `./KenshiMP.Server.exe`
4. Forward port **27800 UDP** on your router/firewall
5. Players connect via your IP address or the server browser

### Server Commands
```
status   - Show server info
players  - List connected players
kick <id> - Kick a player
say <msg> - Broadcast system message
save     - Save world state
stop     - Shutdown server
```

## Building (Developers Only)

Most players should use the [pre-built release](https://github.com/The404Studios/Kenshi-Online/releases/latest). Only follow these steps if you want to build from source.

### Requirements
- **Visual Studio 2022** with C++ Desktop Development workload
- **CMake 3.20+**
- **vcpkg** (for dependency management)

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone with submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/The404Studios/Kenshi-Online.git
cd Kenshi-Online

# 2. Install dependencies via vcpkg
vcpkg install enet:x64-windows
vcpkg install minhook:x64-windows
vcpkg install nlohmann-json:x64-windows
vcpkg install spdlog:x64-windows

# 3. Configure with CMake
cmake -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[vcpkg root]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake

# 4. Build
cmake --build build --config Release

# 5. Output
# build/bin/Release/KenshiMP.Injector.exe
# build/bin/Release/KenshiMP.Core.dll
# build/bin/Release/KenshiMP.Server.exe
```

### Manual Library Setup (without vcpkg)
Place the following in the `lib/` directory:
- `lib/enet/` - [ENet 1.3.x](https://github.com/lsalzman/enet) source
- `lib/minhook/` - [MinHook 1.3.3](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook) source
- `lib/json/` - [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) source
- `lib/spdlog/` - [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) source

## Technical Details

### Injection Method
Uses the Ogre3D plugin system (proven by RE_Kenshi). The injector modifies
`Plugins_x64.cfg` to add `Plugin=KenshiMP.Core`, and Ogre loads our DLL
automatically during engine initialization. No process injection or manual
DLL loading required.

### Pattern Scanner
Scans kenshi_x64.exe in-memory using IDA-style byte patterns with wildcards.
Resolves RIP-relative addresses for x64 code. Falls back to known pointer chains
from Cheat Engine community.

### State Synchronization
- **Entity ownership**: Each player owns their squad; server owns NPCs
- **Interpolation**: 100ms buffer with hermite spline for smooth remote movement
- **Zone interest**: 3x3 zone grid around each player (only sync nearby entities)
- **Delta compression**: float16 position deltas, smallest-three quaternion encoding
